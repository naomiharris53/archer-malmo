<h2><span class="heada">The Bus Ride</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Before we got on the bus, we waited for like 20 minutes on our slow bus. When we were on the bus i sat next to diego. He ate alot of food. While diego was eating we played uno. I won.  When we were getting off the bus it was really cold. When we were outside, noah saw the bird scooters and begged to ride one. It clearly didnt work because he is broke </li>

<h2><span class="heada">The Tour</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>As we all sat there quitly the guy told us about his life. We heard about what he does and how it all got started. Some people listened and others didnt. Some people stared off into the back of their eye lids. (Melvin) As he told us everything, we asked him questions and took a group picture. After we took the picture, we got a tour. </li>

<h2><span class="heada">My Last Meal</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>As the field trip was coming to an end, we made a quick stop at cookout. I was excited of course but i didnt think of how long the line would be until i walked in. I think we filled 90% of the place and payed enough to keep them in buisness for another month. I stood in the line and finally ordered. I felt fat. I ordered 2 hotdogs, fries, and sweet tea. I ordered something else but i dont know how to spell it. I didnt realise that when I ordered it would be my last meal. I got my wisdom teeht out and to this day have yet to eat again.</li>

<h2><span class="heada">The Ride Back</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>On the ride back we were squished. I think our bus driver was a little wack. We spent $5 on milkshakes and she came and took them all. People in the back of the bus got to the point to where we put our drinks in our shirts. I may not be broke but i dont waste $5 on just anything.</li>
